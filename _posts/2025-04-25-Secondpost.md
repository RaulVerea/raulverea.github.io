In recent years, cloud computing has revolutionized various industries, and biomedicine is no exception. Cloud infrastructures are increasingly used to store, analyze, and share massive amounts of biomedical data. This shift has enabled more efficient research, faster drug discovery, and improved patient care through the integration of advanced computational tools and vast datasets.

**Cloud Technologies in Biomedicine**

Cloud infrastructure provides scalable resources that are crucial in managing the growing complexity of biomedical data. Whether it's genomic data, medical imaging, or electronic health records (EHR), the cloud offers the computational power needed to analyze and store these vast datasets. Let's take a look at some of the key areas where cloud infrastructure is making an impact in biomedicine:
## 1. **Genomics and Personalized Medicine**

Cloud computing allows researchers to process massive genomic datasets more efficiently. Tools like Google Cloud's Genomics and AWS's Elastic MapReduce (EMR) enable scientists to perform computationally intensive operations such as sequencing and analyzing genomes at scale. This ability to analyze personalized genomic data helps in the development of targeted therapies, offering a more precise approach to treating diseases like cancer.

## 2. **Medical Imaging and AI Integration**

Cloud platforms have become integral in managing medical imaging data. Cloud-based systems, combined with artificial intelligence (AI), are being used to interpret medical images such as MRIs and CT scans with high accuracy. Services like Microsoft Azure's AI-powered healthcare tools are used to train models for early disease detection, improving diagnosis time and accuracy.

## Here is a secondary heading

[This is a link to a different site](https://deanattali.com/) and [this is a link to a section inside this page](#local-urls).

Here's a table:

| Number | Next number | Previous number |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| Five | Six | Four |
| Ten | Eleven | Nine |
| Seven | Eight | Six |
| Two | Three | One |

You can use [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) to write LaTeX expressions. For example:
When \\(a \ne 0\\), there are two solutions to \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) and they are $$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$

How about a yummy crepe?

![Crepe](https://beautifuljekyll.com/assets/img/crepe.jpg)

It can also be centered!

![Crepe](https://beautifuljekyll.com/assets/img/crepe.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}

## Boxes
You can add notification, warning and error boxes like this:

### Notification

{: .box-note}
**Note:** This is a notification box.

### Warning

{: .box-warning}
**Warning:** This is a warning box.

### Error

{: .box-error}
**Error:** This is an error box.

## Local URLs in project sites {#local-urls}

When hosting a *project site* on GitHub Pages (for example, `https://USERNAME.github.io/MyProject`), URLs that begin with `/` and refer to local files may not work correctly due to how the root URL (`/`) is interpreted by GitHub Pages. You can read more about it [in the FAQ](https://beautifuljekyll.com/faq/#links-in-project-page). To demonstrate the issue, the following local image will be broken **if your site is a project site:**

![Crepe](/assets/img/crepe.jpg)

If the above image is broken, then you'll need to follow the instructions [in the FAQ](https://beautifuljekyll.com/faq/#links-in-project-page). Here is proof that it can be fixed:

![Crepe]({{ '/assets/img/crepe.jpg' | relative_url }})
