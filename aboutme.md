Mountain Sports: When I’m not immersed in work or studies, you’ll find me in the mountains—whether it's hiking, climbing, or skiing. I find that nature not only challenges me physically but also keeps my mind sharp.

Traveling: I’m always looking for my next adventure. Traveling helps me stay inspired and gives me new perspectives on life, culture, and technology.
